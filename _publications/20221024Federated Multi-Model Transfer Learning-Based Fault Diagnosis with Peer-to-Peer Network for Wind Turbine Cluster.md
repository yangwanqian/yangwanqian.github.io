In this paper, a peer-to-peer network is constructed with one node corresponding to one wind turbine in a cluster. Each node is equivalent and functional replicable with a new federated transfer learning method, including model transfer based on multi-task learning and model fusion based on dynamic adaptive weight adjustment.
